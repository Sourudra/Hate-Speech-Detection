# **Hate Speech Detection in Code-Mixed Indo-Aryan Languages**

## **Problem Statement**  
Languages are crucial in communication, culture, and social interactions, particularly in multilingual regions such as South Asia. Hindi and Bengali, two of the worldâ€™s most spoken Indo-Aryan languages, are central to this landscape.  
- **Hindi:** 609.5 million speakers, 4th most spoken language globally.  
- **Bengali:** 272 million speakers, 7th most spoken language globally.  

As online platforms grow, these languages have evolved into code-mixed forms like **Hinglish (Hindi-English)** and **Banglish (Bengali-English)**. This blend, while reflecting cultural and practical factors, also leads to increased hate speech in online spaces. The informal and dynamic nature of these languages presents unique detection challenges. This project aims to develop robust methods to detect hate speech in Hinglish and Banglish, contributing to safer digital environments and advancing multilingual NLP research.


## **Results**  
- **Hinglish Model Accuracy:** 72%  
- **Banglish Model Accuracy:** 75%  
- Built using `bert-base-multilingual-cased`, a pre-trained model supporting over 100 languages.
